# cpprndpass
A random password generator written in C++


# How it works
Run the .exe or .o file depending on your system and follow the on screen instructions.
(Not much else to say here)
Note: Run the .o file in a UNIX shell with ./rndpass.o


# How to compile
The file is prebuilt but you can build it yourself with the gcc compiler (I'm sure
that g++ works too I just don't know how to use it) with:
"gcc rndpass.cpp -lstdc++ -o rndpass.exe" or "gcc rndpass.cpp -lstdc++ -o rndpass.o"
